UpgradeProjectVisualPanel1.jRadioButton1.text=Keep 3.0 Compatibility (Partial Upgrade)
UpgradeProjectVisualPanel1.jRadioButton2.text=Upgrade to 3.1
UpgradeProjectVisualPanel1.jTextPane1.text=As software evolves, old files can get deprecated and need an overhaul.\nThis also happened to SDK Project Files as we moved from 3.0 to 3.1\nLuckily there is this upgrader, which will do all the work for you.\n\n\
Note: In case of emergency, open "nbproject/project.properties" with Netbeans\nand click on the history button in the upper left corner.\nThere you can revert the changes.\n\n\
There are two ways I can do the upgrade: I can do a partial upgrade, which means\nyour file will be marked as a 3.0 project and only backwards-compatible changes\nare applied. That way you won't be able to compile the project under 3.1,\nbut it will work under 3.0 (and stop the warnings in 3.1). Use this way if you manage your dependencies (libs)\nmanually or if you don't use the Netbeans' compile/deploy.\n\n\
The other way is the simple upgrade: Your project will be upgraded to 3.1,\nhowever it won't be openable under 3.0 anymore.
