/**
 * This class will handle all .j3o templates to be simply copied.
 * Starting with NetBeans 8.1 they changed the default action for templates to be using their template engine to parse them.
 * This lead to Encoding Errors since our binary files are, well, binary.
 * Unfortunately the only way to change this default behavior were switches inside the template or the Path (i.e. being placed under java)
 * Also their COPY Action even relies on the StringBuffer, so same issue here.
